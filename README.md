## About Us

The Lemkul Lab uses computational modeling and simulation approaches to study biomolecular structure-function relationships and engage in computer-aided drug design. Our main focus areas are on amyloidogenic and intrinsically disordered proteins, DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes, and phospholipid membrane systems. Our work is primarily driven by the Drude polarizable force field as we are particularly interested in electrostatic properties of these systems.
